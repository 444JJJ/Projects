/*
Constructor 
-   C++ requries a constructor call for each object it has created
-   Constructors are special class fucntions which perform 
    initialisation of every object.
-   The compiler calls the constructor whenever an obejct is created.
-   If there is no constructor, the compiler provides a default 
    constructor that is, a constructor with no parameters
-   Name of constructor function is the same as name of class

First, Construtor name must be the same as the class name
-   This is one way of the compiler knowing they are constructors.

Second, no return type is used for constructors
-   Why not? Since the constructor is called automatically by the 
    system, there's no programme for it to return anything to;
    a return value wouldnt make sense
-   This is the second way the compiler knows they are constructors.

Types of Constructors
-   Default constructors
-   Parameterised constructors
-   Copy constructors
